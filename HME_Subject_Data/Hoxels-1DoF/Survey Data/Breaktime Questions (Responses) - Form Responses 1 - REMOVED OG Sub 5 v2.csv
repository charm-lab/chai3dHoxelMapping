9/8/2023 12:43,1,1,1,"Feedback palpable, tad strong",1,Liked feedback tad more,2,It was harder to grab the cube egg. I had to pay attention more and be mindful of holding that distance between my fingers while moving cube egg,1,,1,Easy breezy,1,"Now that I’ve done the task a lot, it’s easier than before. I still have to be cognizant of the space between my fingers and to hold that position",2,"I didn’t quite remember what pressure feedback corresponded to breaking the cube egg so I went off pain / tolerance. As long as I felt some feedback that wasn’t too light (so the egg would slip) but wasn’t too strong to the point of pain, I assumed cube egg was held ok.",1,I’m getting hungry so wasn’t paying attention as well,2,Probably hungrier,Cool environment and task!
9/8/2023 14:53,2,2,2,No,2,,4,,2,,2,,4,,3,,4,,3,,
9/8/2023 16:03,3,3,2,,3,,5,,2,,3,,4,,5,,3,,3,,Why don’t you add an experiment for gradation color change
9/9/2023 13:27,4,1,4,,3,"I feel that you should let us rank the difficulty of these tasks since I may have forgotten my selection / rating for the previous tasks
",3,I felt that grasping the cube was slightly more difficult than previous tasks,4,My wrist feels very tight during these tasks,3,,2,This is probably easiest thus far,3,,3,,1,,
9/14/2023 14:53,16 (5),2,3,,3,I noticed that the pressure from the machine made me squeeze the cube harder ,1,,2,"While carrying the cube was slightly harder, I felt as though I completed the task much quicker ",2,,1,,1,,2,I found it to be harder to gauge how hard to hold the cube without it turning red this round ,2,,
9/11/2023 12:02,6,3,1,,1,,2,,1,,2,,1,,2,,1,,1,,"Because the tasks remained the same throughout the experiment, the instance with haptic feedback ended up helping me know which exact finger pose I need in order to complete the trials without haptics. If the tasks varied in some way, I would’ve felt much more difficulty without haptics feedback."
9/11/2023 17:07,7,1,2,,3,,3,,3,Less forceful feedback. It hurt a little despite me loosening the strap,2,,2,,3,,2,,2,,Fun! I liked the light feedback more. The strong feedback was uncomfortable/painful despite me loosening the strap
9/11/2023 18:49,8,2,3,,2,,3,,2,,2,,3,,4,Taking into account that the visual indicator of color change due to exceeding force limit is no longer there,4,,3,,It was really nice and as a first time user felt like I was getting better doing more tasks
9/11/2023 20:06,9,3,2,,2,,2,probably would not have been as easy if I hadn’t gone through the previous trials,1,,1,,2,,1,,2,,1,,
9/12/2023 11:42,10,1,3,,2,,1,It seemed less distracting and faster/easier not having ha-tic feedback and only using memory and visual cues,2,"Never mind, haptic feedback is useful, but maybe just overturned so it seems like I have less room to squeeze than I really to because the feedback is so strong",2,Hand starting position seems somewhat impactful but not standardized ,4,,3,,2,,4,,"The pneumatic tubing was a bit cumbersome, and the haptic feedback was a bit strong, bordering on painful when squeezing too hard"
9/12/2023 16:50,11,2,3,The pressure feels high even when it’s not breaking,2,"I felt more cautious and therefore slower but I think it helped me grasp more gently once I got the hang of it. In the beginning it just felt like the cube had become super delicate and I kept breaking it, but by the middle I felt a lot more comfortable compared to the previous mode",1,"Broke it in the beginning, later learned how not to, and was able to do it faster",2,Slightly painful but this time I knew I could go faster so I tried to,1,"Loved it, I felt in control ",1,"This one makes me feel rash, like I can touch the hoops however I want and don’t need to pass through them carefully",1,Ahhh I really enjoyed this,2,"Hard to tell if I did better or worse, since breaking the cube wouldn’t have made me visibly fail…I did feel less secure each time I grasped it, worried if I was about to drop it ",3,The high pressure made me want to go fast ,"It was so much fun! 
Took me a while to realize I just had to touch the hoops, I’m not sure if hitting them was causing the cube to break.
I felt very strongly in favor of the gentle pressure mode and strongly uncomfortable in the high pressure mode. The mode with no pressure made me feel lost."
9/13/2023 9:37,12,3,2,"A little bit uncomfortable, esp on the inside of the wrist. Just a little too strong maybe. ",1,,3,,2,,1,,2,,1,Easy but a lot less confident on performance without the color feedback :),2,,2,,
9/13/2023 13:58,13,1,2,,2,It felt more like it was squeezing my wrist ,3,The lack of haptic feedback made it more difficult to tell whether or not I was using enough force to pick up the object,2,,2,Difficult to tell the difference in haptic response (if there is one?) between these tasks and the previous 10 tasks,3,"Same as previous tests with no haptic feedback, but the visual cues (block turning red) do provide a lot of feedback that helps with being more consistent between runs",3,I noticed that I dropped the cube more since I was trying to stay on the lighter side ,3,,4,This was the most difficult task because there was no form of feedback ,My hand was starting to get tired from opening my fingers so wide 
9/13/2023 14:49,14,2,2,,2,,3,,1,,1,Pressure is more comfortable than the last one,4,Difficult to adjust tightness ,1,,4,Not sure to hold with enough tightness,2,Hardness of feedback was a bit too strong ,"I felt three hardness conditions (none, weak, strong) and the weak feedback was the most comfortable for me. "
9/14/2023 11:06,15,3,2,,1,,2,,1,,2,,2,,1,,2,I was focused on not breaking the block,2,Focused on not breaking the blocking ,"The feedback was very helpful but also had me being more conscious about how I was manipulating the block
"
9/14/2023 16:12,17 (16),1,1,"The feedback was a little painful when the block turned red, so I was very incentivized not to have a sharp pressure on my wrist.",1,"The pressure wasn’t as painful as Round 1, so it was easier to learn at my own pace.",2,"Learning with haptics helped me a lot when dialing in how much force I needed to use, and I imagine I could learn to perform almost as well without haptics as with it so long as I train using haptics.",3,"The haptic pressure activated too early, making it hard to me to distinguish the threshold for turning red.",2,Nice hapticking!,1,"I feel like I learn faster with haptics than without them, but once I’ve learnt the right pressure I perform similarly regardless.",3,"The lack of visual cues definitely hindered my force perception, since the haptic feedback was so strong all the time.",2,"I feel like the loss of visual feedback didn’t affect this task much, the haptic feedback was sufficient for me.",2,It was definitely harder to do this task without visual feedback.,"I feel like haptic feedback helped me learn faster, but once I learned how much force to apply my performance was similar regardless of whether haptic feedback was enabled or not. Nice hapticizing!"
9/14/2023 19:54,18 (17),2,3,It seems to go red in the region above the hemisphere for some reason ,4,Seemed easier,4,"Hmm, the feedback seemed to have been distracting in the previous trials",4,I think it might be helpful to have two kinds of feedback - one for when the cube is bumping into a wall and one for when I’m squeezing too hard,4,Maybe shadows to help with perspective ,4,,4,It was alright,4,It was interesting not getting feedback ,4,N/A,"Hmmmm, it was a lot of fun. Very much interested in seeing how I compared to other subjects"
9/15/2023 10:43,19 (18),3,2,,3,,4,Much harder without feedback,3,,2,This feedback felt the most helpful,3,,4,,3,,2,,"Fun, but tricky without visual or tactile feedback!"
