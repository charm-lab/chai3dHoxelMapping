## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### Load the data set 
```{r}
# load the data set here
completionTime <- read_excel("./HMEData-for-R/Completion Time.xlsx")
```


### Perform the Kruskal-Wallis Test
```{r}

# Assuming "Factor1" and "Factor2" are your two factors, and "Value" is the data to be analyzed.
result1 <- kruskal.test(SubjectData ~ Mappings, data = completionTime)
result2 <- kruskal.test(SubjectData ~ SubjectNum, data = completionTime)
#result_interaction <- kruskal.test(SubjectData ~ Mappings * SubjectNum, data = completionTime)
```

### Results of the Kruskal-Wallis Test
```{r}

summ1 <- summary(result1)
summ2 <- summary(result2)
#summary(result_interaction)

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r completionTime, echo=FALSE}
plot(completionTime)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
